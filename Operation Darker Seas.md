# Operation Darker Seas

##Overview:

Under the crust of Europa, in it's deep seas, a large, unidentified object has been showing on deep sea monitoring equipment. Based on other sources of information, Firewall are concerned that this is a large and unregulated Arificial General Intelligence (AGI), built to primarily gather data from the deep seas but also shows faint energy signatures also corresponding to nano-fabrication processes. It is unknown if there are any restrictions to the use of any possible nano-fabrication units or what blueprints are availabe to the machine if any. However it can be assumed that the AGI could some day have full unrestricted access to the nano-fabrication and design processes. This is a cause for concern and investigation. 

Sentinels have been dispatched to Europa to verify the existance of this object, determine if it operated by an AGI, retreive a copy of it's blackbox, if it has one, or as much of it's data stores as possible and as a last resort, destroy the object if it poses a threat to humanity as a rouge or infected AI.

The story starts on with all sentinels on small transport ship that is making a routine trip to Conamara. It has been done this way rather than egocasting, to not catch the attention of the Junta who controll the area and will likely take an interest in your activites. Once the players have arrived, they have to make means of finding and following leads in order to locate and make contact with the unknown object in the deeps seas of Europa.

##Â Appendix A - About Europa

### Europa:

Europa has 6 settlements, called warrens. The warrens are either built upon the cliff faces of the reefs that grow in the seas or Europa, or hollowed out from the ice. The largest Warren, also home to the space elevator that connects the ice covered sea to the surface is called Conamara, and has five smaller habitats sourrounding it.

Europa's main interest is the life that has evolved under the deep crust of ice for billions of years. There are large 'corals' made from silicate by lithoderms in the sea and these are home to many life forms. However the sea is deep and the pressure make's it hard to get accurate information and mapping data of the sea.

### Conamara

Conamara is the largest habitat on Europa and home to the huge elevator that goes above the ice. This elevator is imperative for supplies, for energy production and commodities needed to support the 1.5 million people that live in the area and also those beyond. 

As it is outside the core systems, there is little to no hypercorp presense in Conamara, aside from the research offices they hold there. Most trade is done independantly, or by small groups. As most people have moved there over time for research, most of the traders and establishments have a realistic, practical feel to them. Not the exuberant high class of Mars, but also nothing like the scum nests on the inner belts.

Specialist aquatic electonics and morph shops are a speciality here, due to the deep see diving needed to do research here. Pretty much any kind of aquatic modifcation and be found or commissioned. 

Notable shops are: 

* GoLow: A specilist in deep sea transportation veheicles and synth morphs
* SHIP: A maker of biological morphs, that also does renting
* Sepple: A maker of deep sea electronics devices

These are the best but most expensive outlets for electonics and morphs. However there are a lot of cheeper outlets and some back ally shops with less than legal items for sale

As well as the Electronics and Morphs, there are a numbner of semi-famous establishments to be found as well as usual data, industrial, morph and pleasure services.

Notable places for players may be:

* Europa Museum: Home to some physical artifacts and some public data about the seas of Europa.
* Traders Hall: A large square where traders hawk wares of all kind.
* The View: A large lit view of under the habita showing the coral reef below.
* Anchored Hotel: A hotel that protudes in to the water. Also offers backup and resleving services to those who stay.
* Mermaid Bay: A pleasure house, that insists on a old Earth medieval sea theme.


### The Jobian Junta
Jupiter is in the Jovian Republic controlled section of the outer systems. Europa is more speicially controlled by the Jovian Junta, who act as a protection racket to ensure that inhabitants, visitors and researches pay in order ot access the colonies below the ice, as well as the tight control of knowledge export of life below Europa. . It is likely that the Junta will take a deep interest in any visitors that are unknown to them.
